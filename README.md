## Project Title:
An Energy-Efficient FPGA-Based Sleep Apnea Detection System

## Project Description:
This project addresses the prevalent issue of sleep apnea, a disorder causing interruptions in breathing during sleep, which impacts health significantly. The project focuses on developing an energy-efficient hardware system for real-time detection of sleep apnea using EEG signals. By leveraging specific EEG signal features and a Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) classifier, the system aims to provide high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity while maintaining low power consumption.

## Key Objectives:
- Implement a low-power hardware design optimized for minimal dynamic power consumption
- Achieve latency reduction to enable real-time processing of EEG signals for immediate detection and feedback
- Minimize the utilization of FPGA resources (e.g., LUTs, slice registers, DSPs) while maintaining performance to allow cost-effective implementations

## Technology Stack:
Hardware: 

Software Tools: MATLAB, Xilinx Vivado Design Suite

Classifier: Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM)

## Expected Outcomes:
- A functional prototype of an FPGA-based apnea detection system demonstrating real-time operation
- Detailed Performance metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, and resource utilization

## Timeline:
